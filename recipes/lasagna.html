    <p>Recipe for Lasagna</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce)can good-quality tomato sauce</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Start by making the sauce </strong> with ground beef, bell peppers, onions, 
            and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes. The three kinds of 
            tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready. </strong> We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesan -- like the mix of tomatoes, this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>From there, it's just an assembly job. </strong> A cup of meat sauce, a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong>
        </li>
    </ol>
